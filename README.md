# Corinth Code Challenge

This is a Next.js frontend for the SWAPI API, providing a searchable list of Star Wars characters.

## Netlify

A live version of the project is available at [corinth-code-challenge.netlify.app](https://corinth-code-challenge.netlify.app).

## Build

Building follows a normal Next.js process.
First, run

```bash
npm i
```

or

```bash
yarn
```

then build to a dev server or a production build.

### Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

### Test Using Jest

Jest is available for running tests via

```bash
npm run test
```

or

```bash
yarn test
```

Though there aren't many tests available, this is what I would improve if I could improve any one thing.
